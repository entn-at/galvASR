The purpose of the strange kaldi/kaldi directory is so that we can
prefix our #include's in C++ code with a "namespace" suggesting to
clearly document that we are including files from kaldi.

i.e., we can do #include "kaldi/src/matrix/matrix-lib.h" instead of
just #include "matrix/matrix-lib.h", which doesn't signal to the
reader that Kaldi code is being included.
